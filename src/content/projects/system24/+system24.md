System24 is a Discord theme that mimics the aesthetics of old-school text-based user interfaces (TUIs). It was heavily inspired by the [Spicetify "text" theme](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes/tree/master/text). The theme features a monospaced font, a darkened color scheme, sharp corners. Similar to many TUIs, each "panel" is labelled with a title and a border. The theme is completely customizable through CSS variables.
