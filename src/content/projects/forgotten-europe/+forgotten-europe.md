The Forgotten Europe Project is a nonprofit that aims to enlighten the world with the stories, traditions, and history of Central-Eastern Europe that are omitted from mainstream education. It was created by my friend Liam Krol in 2022. The project needed a website to better convey their mission to the world and to host content they produced, and I was happy to help.

The site is a static site built with SvelteKit and hosted on Netlify. It hosts a repository of survivor interviews, curriculum for schools produced by the project, and a blog written by project members on relevent topics. These content features are powered by mdsvex and markdown files generated through DecapCMS. Decap is interesting because it is a headless CMS that is Git-based. So whenever changes to the content are made the site is rebuilt and redeployed as a completely static site. This eliminaties the API calls and database management that is typical of CMSs, giving better performance overall. However, Decap is a bit lacking in user-friendliness and features.

This was the first "real" website I worked on. I definitely learned a lot throughout the development process, specifically about content management, accessibility, mobile support, and SEO. I also had the opportunity of redesigning their logo and branding, which was a fun challenge.
