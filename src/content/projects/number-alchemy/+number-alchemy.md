Number Alchemy is a math game about combining numbers. It is based on the [24 puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(puzzle)) that I would play with my family growing up. The goal is to combine four numbers using the basic arithmetic operations to get 24. The game provides both a casual mode and a timed challenge mode. It also includes a tutorial, high scores, and haptics and theme settings. The game is designed to be intuitive but fun, with a clean and minimal interface.

Number Alchemy is available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.refact0r.number_alchemy).

This was my first mobile app. I chose to use Flutter because I was interested in the framework's cross-platform potential. Coming from a web dev background, I was definitely not used to Flutter's widget-based UI system. I chose to stick with Flutter's material design style, which I think works well for the game's interface. I was pleasantly surprised by the Dart language, as it felt like a modern version of Java. To control the game logic in an organized way, I had to learn how to use Provider state management. I feel like developing this game taught me to be more intentional about my code structure and design, creating interfaces and classes instead of just writing code. Navigating all the intricacies of a mobile app and the Google Play Store was also a valuable learning experience.
